La Solidarité Pharmacy (Healing Customers First Pharmacy) - Revitalization and Relocation to Nakivale Refugee Camp

Welcome to the La Solidarité Pharmacy (Healing Customers First Pharmacy) GitHub repository! This initiative aims to provide essential healthcare services to the Nakivale Refugee Camp in Uganda. Originally based in Mbanza Ngungu, DRC, the pharmacy served the community for over a decade by offering affordable medications, particularly to low-income families. After its closure due to my displacement to Uganda, we are now working to revitalize and relocate the pharmacy to Nakivale, where we aim to make a lasting impact by providing healthcare services tailored to the needs of refugees.

Why Invest in La Solidarité Pharmacy?
Proven Social Impact: The pharmacy has a history of supporting vulnerable populations by providing affordable medicines, including credit-based transactions for those in financial hardship.
Urgent Need in Nakivale: With a large population of refugees, Nakivale Camp faces significant healthcare challenges. Our pharmacy will help address these needs by offering vital medications at accessible prices.
Data-Driven Operations: We will introduce a data-driven system that ensures efficient management, targeted social support, and credit offerings based on a patient’s verified financial situation and payment history.
Sustainability and Growth: By adopting modern technology, we aim to ensure long-term sustainability, efficient service, and scalability beyond Nakivale.
Key Objectives
Relocate to Nakivale Refugee Camp: Establish a fully functional pharmacy within the camp to serve refugees and residents.
Implement a Data-Driven System for Credit Management: Use a Database Management System to track customer data, including healthcare histories and financial capabilities. Only verified customers, whose data shows consistency in their ability to repay, will be eligible for credit-based transactions.
Targeted Social Impact: Continue our mission to support those in genuine financial hardship by leveraging data to identify and assist individuals who truly need credit, ensuring that essential medications are accessible to everyone.
Predictive Analytics for Credit Risk: The system will not only track customers’ payment histories but also use predictive analytics to assess their capacity to repay future credits, ensuring that the pharmacy can maintain financial stability while serving those in need.
How Our Credit System Works
Our innovative data-driven credit system will ensure that medicines on credit are only extended to tracked and confirmed customers. Here's how it works:

Customer Verification: The system will collect and track customer data, including purchase history, repayment records, and evidence of financial hardship.
Credit Assessment: Based on the collected data, the system will evaluate the customer's consistency and ability to repay.
Predictive Modelling: Using AI-driven predictive analytics, the system will forecast a customer’s future capacity to repay based on their financial history, spending patterns, and personal circumstances.
Responsible Lending: Only customers who are verified as being in a difficult financial situation and have a good track record or demonstrated potential to repay will be granted medicines on credit.
This ensures that credit is offered responsibly and that the pharmacy remains sustainable while still supporting the most vulnerable customers.

Project Phases
Relocation & Setup: Secure a location within Nakivale Refugee Camp, engage local authorities, and obtain the necessary permits for operation.
Digital Infrastructure: Implement a Database Management System to handle inventory, customer data, and predictive analytics for credit transactions.
Staffing & Training: Hire local healthcare professionals and train them to use the system effectively.
Launch & Community Engagement: Reopen the pharmacy under its original branding, with a focus on data-driven operations and community outreach.
Financial Requirements
We are seeking $5,000 to cover the following:

Relocation and Setup: $1,000 (logistics, permits, and space setup)
Database System and Tech Setup: $1,700 (software for inventory, customer tracking, and credit assessment)
Medicine Restocking: $1,000
Legal and Administrative Costs: $500
Marketing and Community Outreach: $800
Expected Social Impact
By relocating La Solidarité Pharmacy to Nakivale Refugee Camp and introducing a data-driven credit system, we will:

Provide affordable access to essential medicines for refugees and vulnerable populations.
Extend medicines on credit only to those who truly need it, ensuring that resources are used responsibly.
Empower financially struggling customers by offering them access to healthcare while carefully managing the risk of non-repayment through predictive analytics.
Contribute to improving healthcare access and outcomes within Nakivale Camp, offering a model that can be expanded to other underserved communities.
